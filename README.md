# My Tampermonkey scripts

I once had many of these, but then, one fateful day, I reinstalled Windows and
lost all of them. I guess because they are not backed up anymore and exist in
your browser's local storage, or something.

Anyways, I'd like to not lose them anymore, so now I track them here. It is a
little annoying to keep them in sync, but it's better than nothing.
